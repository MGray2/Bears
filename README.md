# Bears

## History

> In the past I have made several video games one of the titles being _Bears_. It was a survival game about a mysterious dissapearance of human existance with you, the player, as the last one. Empty towns and cities are now home to aggressive bears. I dont have any surviving examples of the games but that is what this project is for.

## This Project

> In this project I will be retelling the bears story by a terminal based video game while learning c++.
